# Bionicle-Canon-Archive
I'm trying to group together instructions and bricklink xml lists for all (or at least the most I can find) of the canon models,I hope it will be useful to someone

None of the instruction in this repository is made by me, I'm just trying to group them together. All of the credits for the instructions go to the orginal creators, mostly are from TLROsborne and Vahki6, so huge thanks to them and everyone else who made free instructions for these models.

What is mine is all of the bricklink xml files I made for the different models. 

That said, I may have made mistakes while creating them and if you find them please tell me so that I can correct everything ASAP.

Also I'm from Italy and I reckon some of my English might not be perfect, I'm trying to use only my knowledge and avoid all of the translator apps, so yeah, correct me whenever it is needed.

EDIT: seems like this is too heavy for github, I will keep updating the google drive one at this point: here is the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OcUDyd7A6mObSkMENK04ADmtb6MH_EGk?usp=drive_link
